Classes:
- HTMLReader
- FileGatherer
- Analyzer


Needed Inputs:
Username



HTMLReader:
    Returns: Occurance of each role
             Occurance of each player
             Winrate of role
             Winrate of alignment
             Winrate of role (you)
             Winrate of alignment (you)
             Occurance of role (you)

             Winrate format:
             wins/total occurance (PERCENT%)

    Steps to take (I think):
    - Try removing everything that starts with < and ends with > w/ regex


<Username (In Game), [username(Actual),Role, ALIVE = 1 DEAD = 0]>
